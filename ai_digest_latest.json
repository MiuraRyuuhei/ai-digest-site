A small team of researchers at Google decided to apply deep learning to various genome sequencing challenges, making it faster, more accurate and more efficient. What began in 2015 as a foundational research effort has now evolved into a global initiative, including partnerships with scientists across the globe."}, {"title": "DeepSomatic, an open-source AI model, is speeding up genetic analysis for cancer research.", "url": "https://blog.google/technology/research/deepsomatic-an-open-source-ai-model-is-speeding-up-genetic-analysis-for-cancer-research/", "published": "2025-10-17 02:05", "summary": "DeepSomatic uses convolutional neural networks to differentiate between inherited variants and the acquired somatic variants that drive cancer. The tool is proven to outperform current methods at spotting these key variants, particularly insertions and deletions. We have made both the tool and its high-quality training dataset openly available to speed up cancer research globally. Google Research is making foundational breakthroughs that have real, tangible impact for people."}, {"title": "Google Cloud C4 Brings a 70% TCO improvement on GPT OSS with Intel and Hugging Face", "url": "https://huggingface.co/blog/gpt-oss-on-intel-xeon", "published": "2025-10-16 09:00", "summary": "Google Cloud C4 Brings a 70% TCO improvement on GPT OSS with Intel and Hugging Face Published October 16, 2025 Update on GitHub C4 Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to…"}, {"title": "Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow", "url": "https://blog.google/technology/ai/veo-updates-flow/", "published": "2025-10-16 01:00", "summary": "We're introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures.
